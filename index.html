    <h2>Gym Class Introduces Competitive Napping as New Sport</h2>
    <p class="byline">By Jordan Blake | Springfield High Gazette | Oct. 2, 2025</p>
    <p>SPRINGFIELD ‚Äî Springfield High School has added a new sport to its gym program: competitive napping.</p>
    <p>The program, described by administrators as ‚Äúinnovative stress relief,‚Äù asks students to lie on mats while judges score them on snoring consistency, stillness and overall relaxation.</p>
    <p>‚ÄúThis is the most rested I‚Äôve ever been in school,‚Äù said sophomore Trevor Maxwell, captain of the nap team. ‚ÄúI trained for weeks by staying up late playing video games so I‚Äôd be extra tired for practice.‚Äù</p>
    <p>Principal Linda Carrington praised the sport as a ‚Äúforward-thinking‚Äù addition. ‚ÄúIf e-sports can be considered athletics, so can naps.‚Äù</p>
    <p>The competitive napping team, nicknamed the Springfield Sleepers, has already designed matching pajama uniforms. Athletic Director Marcus Long confirmed that the school will compete against nearby districts.</p>
    <p>A flyer claimed that 87 percent of students nap more effectively under fluorescent lighting. A supposed study by the National Association of Restful Athletics (NARA) linked snoring volume to GPA improvement.</p>
    <p>Parents are divided. ‚ÄúBack in my day we did push-ups,‚Äù said one. ‚ÄúNow my kid is being graded on how well he drools on a pillow.‚Äù</p>
    <p>Still, guidance counselors say more students are requesting to transfer into nap-based gym classes.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>I ‚Äúcooked‚Äù nearly every part of this story. Competitive napping does not exist as a gym sport, and all quotes, statistics, and organizations were fabricated. I invented characters such as Trevor Maxwell, Principal Carrington and Marcus Long, along with the fake National Association of Restful Athletics.</p>
    <p>This story seems believable because it mixes real issues (student stress and sleep deprivation) with an absurd but possible-sounding solution. The fake numbers and official-sounding association add to the illusion of credibility.</p>
    <p>A fact-checker could easily disprove the claims by looking up NARA, checking the flyer, or contacting officials. None of the sources or statistics are real.</p>
    <p>This kind of fabricated journalism is harmful because it spreads misinformation and undermines trust. Ethical journalism ensures facts are accurate and protects readers, sources, and society from harm.</p>
